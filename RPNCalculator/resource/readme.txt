Assuming that input data is stored in a csv file. There are some things need to consider:

1.		Need to know how many row and column on sheet -> then we will know total how many cells.
2.		Avoid cyclic dependencies in the input data (this is most important part especially if input data is very huge)
3. 	Implement RPN algorithm.
