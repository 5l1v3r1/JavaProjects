Please use Eclipse IDE or similar tool to import project.
Run Junit to test the program.

1. Please read comments in code and see images in directory /docs/ for easy understanding the program.

2. Libs are used:
/lib/

3. unit test:
TreeTest1.java (for tree \docs\test_tree_1.PNG)
TreeTest2.java (for tree \docs\test_tree_2.PNG).

4. It is easy for you to add more test cases in unit test. 
This is just more about algorithm than design pattern so i skipped source code structure design.
There are two different implementations but same functional: setRightNodeForTree and setRightNodeForTree2.
