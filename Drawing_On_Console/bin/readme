Design:

1. create a class "Pixel" that represents for one physical Pixel on the screen.

2. Entire screen is an array of Pixel elements. This array variable is named as "screenData".

3. draw line/rectangle on the screen is just to fill in data on certain elements of the array "screenData" 
and display them on the screen via function "draw2Screen".

4. coordinate of a pixel at (x,y) is respective to element array[y][x].

5. to fill color bucket we using recursive with quit condition is "border reaching".

II. Run program.
